Elan Indulgence, is an E-Commerce marketplace which connects up coming fashion designers/boutiques with customers and vice-versa. A designer/boutique can sign up with Elan as a merchant and his/her collections will be showcased on the site along with receiving potential orders from customers for personalized outfits. The customer signs up with elan to make a purchase or place a customized order to a designer. The customer has a plethora of collections from various designers to go through all in one place. If a customer places an customized order he/she is further provided with a messaging client to exchange ideas with the designer for further personalization which simulates real world experience from the comforts of their homes. The products are delivered to the customers across the globe. Shipping rates and delivery time are specific to each designer. Customers pay the order amount upfront which is refundable under certain conditions. After a free trial period, the designers are charged a minimal incentive by Elan for every sale they make.
